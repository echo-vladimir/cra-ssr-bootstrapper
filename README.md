# cra-ssr-bootstrapper

`npm run ssr` builds the app, transpiles server code and starts Node.

Fixes to do before 1.0
- [x] Create server bundle instead of transpiling to be able to include assets such as `PNG`.
- [ ] Better documentation
- [ ] Increase example project to have several code split routes
